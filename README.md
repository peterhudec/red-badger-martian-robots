# Martial Robots

This is a partial solution to the Red Badger coding challenge.
Only the raw mechanism is implemented, without any user interface.
The only thing you can run is tests, which only test the functions against
sample data from the assignment.

# How to use

Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:peterhudec/red-badger-martian-robots.git
```

Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

Run tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

# TODO

* [ ] Implement the `martianRobots` function, which takes the input string
      as specified in the assignment, parses it into a data structure compatible
      with the signature of `martianRobots` and returns the result formatted as
      specified in the assignment.
* [ ] Implement a CLI user interface.
